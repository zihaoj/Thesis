The impact of pileup effects on the performance of the CNN tagger is evaluated 
by considering events with a different number of reconstructed primary vertices ($N_\text{PV}$).
The test sample is divided into three bins: $N_\text{PV}<13$, $13<N_\text{PV}<20$ and $N_\text{PV}>20$.  
The distributions of the pixel intensities do vary with pileup, 
but the performance of the CNN tagger is found to be robust. 
This is demonstrated by Figure~\ref{fig:pileup}. 
% shows that the efficiencies for a specific working point vary with the pileup conditions (by a similar amount as jet width), but the overall discriminating performance is not significantly degraded (ROC curve is largely invariant).

Calorimeter-based discrimination is not only effected by in-time pileup (quantified by $N_\text{PV}$) but also by out-of-time pileup. 
Figure~\ref{fig:pileup2} compares the tagger performance in two different regimes of the average number of collisions per bunch crossing ($\mu$) regimes corresponding to the out-of-time pileup representative of LHC Run 2 conditions.
