The flavor fraction fits are performed in each bins of each observable to determine the $b\bar b $ fractions in data. 

\subsection{\drbb}

In total, there are six bins of the \drbb observable we are measuring. The flavor fraction fits are performed in $\Delta R \in\{[0.2, 0.25], [0.25, 0.3], [0.3, 0.4], [0.4,0.5], [0.5,0.6], [0.6,0.7]\}$. An example of post-fit Data/MC comparison is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dR-fit-example}. Refer to \ref{sec:app-subsd0fits} for all pre-fits and post-fits plots. The MC predicted and fitted fraction of each flavor component are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dR-fitfrac}. Four sets of fit cross check are performed: (1) using \sdzero as discriminant (2) using \subsubsdzero (3) using $p_T$ parameterized templates and (4) without track jet kinematic reweighting. The cross check results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:dR-fitfrac-crosscheck}. We observe closure of the fitted signal (`BB') event fraction in all the cross checks within fitting uncertainties. The size of each of the systematic uncertainty is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:dRsys}.
