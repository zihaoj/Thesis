The flavor fraction fits are performed in each bin of each observable to determine the $b\bar b $ fractions in data. For \drbb, fits are performed in $\drbb \in\{[0.2, 0.25], [0.25, 0.3], [0.3, 0.4], [0.4,0.5], [0.5,0.6], [0.6,0.7]\}$. For \zpt, fits are performed in $\zpt \in\{[0, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2], [0.2, 0.3], [0.3,0.4], [0.4,0.5]\}$. For \mpt, fits are performed in $\mpt \in\{[-3, -2.2], [-2.2, -1.9], [-1.9, -1.5], [-1.5, -1.1], [-1.1,0]\}$. For \dphi, fits are performed in $\dphi \in\{[0, \pi/5], [\pi/5, 2\pi/5], [2\pi/5, 3\pi/5], [3\pi/5, 4\pi/5], [4\pi/5, \pi]\}$. Examples of post-fit Data/MC comparisons for each variable are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fit-example}. Refer to \ref{sec:app-subsd0fits} for all pre-fits and post-fits data-MC comparisons. The MC predicted and fitted fraction of each flavor component are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gbb-fitfrac}.

Four sets of fit cross check are performed: (1) using \sdzero as discriminant (2) using \subsubsdzero (3) using $p_T$ parameterized templates and (4) with track jet kinematic re-weighting. The cross check results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:dR-fitfrac-crosscheck}\ref{fig:ZpT-fitfrac-crosscheck}\ref{fig:fracmasspt-fitfrac-crosscheck}\ref{fig:dphi-fitfrac-crosscheck}. We observe closure of the fitted signal (`BB' component) event fraction in all the cross checks within fitting uncertainties. The size of each of the systematic uncertainty is summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:dRsys}\ref{tab:ZpTsys}\ref{tab:fracmassptsys}\ref{tab:dphisys}.
