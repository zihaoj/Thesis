Figure~\ref{fig:truth:dphipt} shows the gluon jet $p_\text{T}$ dependence of the $\Delta\phi$ observable.  Interestingly, Pythia predicts that the difference between polarization on and off should grow with $p_\text{T}$.  Similarly, Fig.~\ref{fig:truth:dphi2} shows that they increase also with mass (and the correlated $\Delta R$ and $z$).  This would be an interesting feature to try to expose with future measurements.
