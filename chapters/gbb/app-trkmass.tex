For boosted Higgs searches, the invariant mass of the $b\bar b$ system is of interest. The analysis is capable of studying the unnormalized (track) invariant mass of the $b\bar b $ system. The analogues to Fig.~\ref{fig:gbbdistributions} and~\ref{fig:gbbresponse} for the mass are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gbbdistributionsm} and~\ref{fig:gbbresponsemass}, respectively. The same fit study as for other observables is presented. The MC distribution of $m_{b\bar b}$ is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:trkmass}. Flavor fraction fits are performed in three bins of $m_{b\bar b} $. The MC prediction and fitted fractions of each flavor is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:trkmass-fitfrac}.
