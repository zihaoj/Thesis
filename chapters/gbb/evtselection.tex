\label{sec:gbb-eventselection}

The overall event selection strategy aims to enhance the purity of gluon splitting to $b \bar b$ events. The gluon splitting process dominates at low $\Delta R$. To isolate this process, we require events to have one $R=1.0$ jet, which is the proxy of the gluon. The $R=1.0$ jet is required to have at least two ghost associated $R=0.2$ track jets, which are proxies of the splitting products of the gluon. The leading track jet is then $b$-tagged. 

The un-prescaled HLT item \textbf{HLT\_j420\_a10\_lcw\_L1J100} triggers on events which have $R=1.0$ jets. The leading $R=1.0$ jet is required to have $p_T>450$ GeV to be on the trigger efficiency pleateu. 

The detailed event selection goes as the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item MC events are subject to event cleaning: the average $p_T$ of leading two $R=0.4$ reco jets is less than 1.4 times the $p_T$ of the leading $R=0.4$ truth jet. 
	\item Pass the $R=1.0$ single jet trigger: \textbf{HLT\_j420\_a10\_lcw\_L1J100}
	\item The leading $R=1.0$ jet in the event has $p_T>450$ GeV
        \item The leading $R=1.0$ jet in the event has at least two $R=0.2$ jets ghost matched
	\item The leading track jet passes the 60\% $b$-tagging efficiency working point
\end{enumerate}
