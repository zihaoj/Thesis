\subsection{Interpretation}
\label{sec:gbb-interp}

The data will be made available through HepData so MC authors will be able to compare their models with our data at a later time.  However, it is interesting to provide some comparisons in the ATLAS paper.  Due to the large MC sizes needed for this study, we have privately produced a series of samples discussed in this section.  This setup has been extensively validated, as discussed in Appendix~\ref{sec:app-truthpreds}.
