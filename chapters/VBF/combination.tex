\subsubsection{\Hbb combination}

In summer of 2018, \Hbb is observed at the ATLAS experiment \cite{VHPaper} confirming the Higgs to quark Yukawa coupling. Three separate \Hbb production modes: VH, ttH and VBF including both Run I and Run II data are combined for a measurement. The 7\TeV data and 8\TeV data have luminosity of $4.7\ifb$ and $20.3\ifb$ respectively. The 13\TeV analyses use data with luminosity ranging from $24.5-79.8\ifb$. This combination measured observed signal strength to be $\mu_{\Hbb}= 1.01 \pm 0.20 = 1.01 \pm 0.12\text{(stat.)}^{+0.16}_{-0.15}\text{(syst.)}$ with a $5\sigma$ significance.
