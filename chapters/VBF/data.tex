We use 24.5~\ifb~of $13~\tev{}$ data recorded by the ATLAS detector in
2016. We use only the data that was collected during periods with all
detector subsystems were operational.  Additionally, the online transverse
beamspot position was required to be within 2mm of the nominal detector
center  due to the configuration of the $b$-jet trigger during this
period\footnote{
We use a special GRL from the ATLAS $b$-trigger group
\seqsplit{data16\_13TeV.periodAllYear\_DetStatus-v87-pro20-20\_DQDefects-00-02-04\_PHYS\_StandardGRL\_All\_Good\_25ns\_BjetHLT.xml}.}
%The luminosity determination is reported in Ref.~\cite{lumiwiki}.
The 2015 dataset is not used because the desired topology trigger chains were not available.
