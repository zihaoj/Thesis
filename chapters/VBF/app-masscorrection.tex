We apply energy corrections to b-jets to improve the mass resolution of the final discriminant $M_{b\bar b}$. Two steps of corrections are applied, which are muon in jet correction and PtReco correction. The muon in jet correction adds back the four-vector of soft muon inside the b-jet to b-jet four-vector. After muon in jet correction, the PtReco correction corrects the energy of the b-jet so that the Reco level $M_{b \bar b}$ has the same peak value as the particle level jets in $VH \rightarrow llb \bar b$ process. The nominal and corrected $M_{b \bar b}$ distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MbbCorrection}. After the correction, 88\% of the VBF signal events end up in the mass window [100, 140] GeV which we extract signal, while 7\% leaks into the lower side-band and 5\% leadks into the upper side-band. Same distributions for $Z\rightarrow b \bar b$ are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:MbbCorrection_Z}.
