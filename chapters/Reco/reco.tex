Digital signals from the detectors are processed by software to reconstruct the physics objects in the detector. The most relevant objects for this thesis are the charged particle trajectories (tracks) and bundled decay products of hadrons (jets). This chapter presents the reconstruction methods of them in Sec. \ref{sec:reco-tracking} and \ref{sec:reco-jets} respectively.
