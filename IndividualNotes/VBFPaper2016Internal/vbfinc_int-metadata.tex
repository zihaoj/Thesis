\AtlasAbstract{%
This analysis presents a search with the ATLAS detector for the Standard Model Higgs
boson produced by vector boson fusion (VBF) and decaying to a pair of $b$-quarks using 25 \ifb~at 13 \TeV. The VBF process is predicted to have the second largest Higgs boson production cross section, after the gluon-fusion mechanism. This search exploits the characteristic rapidity-gap topology of VBF production, selecting events with exactly two central $b$-tagged jets which form the Higgs candidate, and two light quark jets which are typically at higher rapidity.  %The upper limit on the cross section times the branching ratio is observed to be XX at the 95\% of confidence level, for Higgs mass of 125 GeV, while the expected upper limit is YY.   
The fitted signal strengths are $\mu_H=2.7^{+2.2}_{-2.0}$ and $\mu_{VBF}=4.1^{+3.2}_{-2.9}$. A combination with an analysis where the Higgs is produced in association with a photon yields yields $\mu_H = 2.5^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ and $\mu_{VBF}=3.0^{+1.7}_{-1.6}$.}
